```Love it! It can handle my heavily loaded 3D renderworks that my previous CPU couldn't (and crashed oftentimes). It's one of the best investment I made in my professional career :) [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9989277720451355}]    

Good card if you're not aiming to get good gaming value (somewhere just a little above my 1080 for gaming). It manages to stay above it's base clock even under sustained 3d load and is very quiet. Manages heavy cuda tasks with ease. [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.998665452003479}]    

Excellent GPU for CAD design its a work card. It can mine if you want to put it through that. Have done some light gaming on a 1080P monitor and runs good but probably depends on the game. 10752 Timespy 3DMark score with the set up its on. Don't panic as it gets really hot depending on what you are doing with it as the default profile keeps fan fixed at a super low RPM(noticed the same thing with a P5000 I used before). I found a software VelocityX from PNY that allows to set a custom fan profile cooling the GPU as much as it can. Little turbine once the fan ramps up so it wont be quiet anymore.

Supports the 'load' of two (2) 27" monitors at 3840x2160 resolution !!! A little bit expensive, but no regrets for the purchase [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9988681077957153}]    

I bought it used and  tried to use it for CAD and simulation due to the situation I barely got to use it 4-5 months after its not working [{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9994974136352539}]    

The best graphic card [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9982917904853821}]```
